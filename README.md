## FAQ

### Default user was switched to root when moving a distro

Set your default user inside your distro by adding this to your `/etc/wsl.conf`

```ini
[user]
default=YOUR_USERNAME
```

Then exit your distro, terminate it (`wsl -t YOUR_DISTRO`) and start it again.

### Standard distro switched when moving it distro

Since we need to unregister to import it with the same name, the standard distro can be switched. Just set your standard distro again:

```sh
wsl -s YOUR_DISTRO
```
